# 💫 About Me:
I’m currently working on building and refining full-stack web applications with a strong focus on scalability, clean architecture, and real-world usability.<br><br>I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, SaaS platforms, and developer-focused tools where code quality, thoughtful design, and long-term maintainability actually matter.<br><br>I’m looking for help with code reviews, system design discussions, and feedback from experienced engineers who have built and shipped production-grade systems.<br><br>I’m currently learning advanced backend patterns, system design fundamentals, performance optimization, and cloud-native deployment workflows.<br><br>Ask me about full-stack development, building projects from scratch, improving developer productivity, and structuring applications that scale beyond toy use cases.<br><br>Fun fact: I care more about clean abstractions and maintainable code than flashy features that look impressive but fall apart under real usage.
